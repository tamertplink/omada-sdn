Controllers
-----------
There are three different flavors of controllers in Omada SDN. Hardware, software, and cloud based. All the network control logics on different controllers are the same and it is flexible to move the network settings from one controller to another. The basic network domain is a site. A site is a logical network domain and usually is mapping to a physical network. You can set up a site and move it around on different controllers for flexibility.

Omada SDN solution devices were evolute from traditional networking devices. All devices can still work in standalone mode without controller. The Omada SDN controller can work standalone without TP-Link cloud service. Depends on your design and your favorites, you can design a different network styles with Omada SDN solutions.
