Installation
============

The Omada SDN solution includes the hardware, software, and cloud-based controller, Omada EAP wireless access points, JetStream managed business switches, and SafeStream business routers.

Controllers
-----------

There are three different flavors of controllers in Omada SDN. Hardware, software, and cloud based. All the network control logics on different controllers are the same and it is flexible to move the network settings from one controller to another. The basic network domain is a site. A site is a logical network domain and usually is mapping to a physical network. You can set up a site and move it around on different controllers for flexibility.

All the Omada SDN devices can work in standalone mode. No controller required to make it work.
