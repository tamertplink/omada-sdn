There are many factors to consider when designing an efficient data network for a church. The easy management from manager to manager, the framework stability, the convergence use of the network resources, and a good overall cost for continuous executions. 4K auditorium video, audio/ video sources from the Internet, and the social media video streaming support. The Omada SDN managed switches can be easily managed with complex audio, video, and data converged environments.

Multiple 4K video and audio streaming
-------------------------------------

You may have multiple 4K video cameras in the theater and want to stream out to the control room and multiple digital displays. A single 4K video stream can cost you 10 to 30 Mbps bandwidth and a typical audio stream costs 6 Mbps on each flow. You can use multicast to ease the bandwidth demands, but still, distributing the audio and video everywhere, you need a strong 10G backbone bandwidth support. The Omada SDN 10G uplink gigabit switches and the 10G fully managed aggregation switches support the demanding network design. Together with IGMP snooping, link aggregation, and DSCP/COS queued QoS services, guarantees the performance on every services and events.

Full 10G Networking
-------------------

The Omada SDN SFP+ 10G fiber switch aggregates all the 10G uplink gigabit managed switches and expands the whole bandwidth throughout the church video and audio systems. HD cameras, displays, speakers, and microphones. All 10G unmanaged switches provide a fool proof strategy in network management and with bandwidth management.
