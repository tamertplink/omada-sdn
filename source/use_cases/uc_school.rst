Digital education is heavily growing, at school, or remote. Providing a good WiFi network to each classroom is one of the important frameworks to build.  An indoor/outdoor video surveillance network can help monitor the activities and increase safety.

Network topology
----------------

A typical school network is similar to an office network including router, switches and wireless access points. Using a hardware controller to manage the school network is the best choice in most of the cases. The Omada SDN router comes with network load balance and VPN features. You can connect up to 4 ISPs to balance the data usage or prioritize the traffic.

Guest Networking
----------------

You may want to provide a secure guest network for the visitors. Providing a dedicated guest wireless network name (SSID) and preventing access to the company network is important. You can simply create a new wireless name and choose the Guest Networking and then the guest network is set.
