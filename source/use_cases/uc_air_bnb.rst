Sharing an additional house or an extra bedroom through Airbnb can turn your property to a cash cow and meet some new friends at the same time. To make your guest feel like at home , you will want to provide a good guest WiFi connection with a good control.

Most of the Airbnb hosts start providing WiFi service with a soho router with the guest network features. That will work to share the Internet, but totally no control of it. For traffic control or preventing legal issues, you may want a better system to manage the network.

Guest Networking
----------------

The first thing you want to control is separate the guest network to your home wireless. Provide a dedicated guest wireless network name (SSID) and prevent access to the home network is important. And, it is easy to set up on the Omada SDN. Just create a new wireless name and choose the **Guest Networking** and then everything is set.

You want to share a handsome amount of bandwidth to your guest, but donâ€™t want all the bandwidth taken by the guest. Most of the guest clients require the most 3 ~ 5Mbps for HD video streaming. You can limit the bandwidth by the wireless ID, or by the client. Just attach the rule to the wireless or the client and the SDN system will do the rest for you.
