Hang around the pool to enjoy the chill and fun. Read a book, share a photo, chat with friends, or watch the video clips. Yes, you definitely need the WiFi to make that happen. 

Providing WiFi services in the pool area is easy. An EAP225-Outdoor access point can provide a reliable signal around the pool. The outdoor EAP is IP67 waterproof  rating which is ready for outdoor use.

You can enable the wireless mesh feature on the Omada SDN controller. Once it is enabled, the EAP225-Outdoor can extend to different service areas, just power on the additional EAP225-Outdoor access point. The mesh network manager will handle everything else for you.
