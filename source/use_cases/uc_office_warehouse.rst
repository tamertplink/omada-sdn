Deploy WiFi in the warehouse can be very different from deploying WiFi in the office. The high ceiling can lengthen the wireless path. The building material may cause reflections and therefore interference everywhere. Carefully choosing the way mounting the wireless access points can optimize the wireless networking.

Ways to mount the access points
-------------------------------

The office wireless access points are usually designed as ceiling mount. If you simply use the deployment rule in the office area and apply it to the high ceiling warehouse area, you may find the wireless coverage area can be heavily overlapped.  This type of installation can work, but is not the most efficient way. The large overlapping wireless coverage not only decreases the delivery efficiency, but also increases the possible interferences.

Closer installation by lowering the height of the access point or mount on the wall can shorten the communication distance and get better communication. If the lower ceiling mount and wall mount cannot fit your service area, using a directional antenna service the focused area can be the alternative solution as well.

In the racks
------------

You may need to carry a barcode reader going to the rack area to check your goods. And, the goods on the rack can block the wireless signal if you are not deploying wireless signals on every aisle.
Deploying access point on every isle can be ideal, but not a must have requirement. To find out how to place your access points, you need wireless signal simulation and site surveys. The wireless paths may change from empty warehouse to a space full of goods. You may have to make multiple wireless site surveys to optimize the network.
