The Omada SDN layer 3 remote control can be designed over a large campus network, or over the Internet. Set up an Omada controller in the district office, you can manage all the network traffic in all schools. It saves time and resources in network management and IT personnel.

Students lack of Internet
-------------------------
There are a number of ways to help rural students who have no Internet services doing homework by accessing the school network. Longer the library hours, open the school parking lot WiFi access, or send a Google school bus to the location nearby the student homes. Again, you need a managed network for the network security and traffic monitoring to evaluate and improve the remote learning.
