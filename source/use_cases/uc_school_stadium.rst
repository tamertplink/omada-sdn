Providing high density wireless connections can be challenging. The most prevalent design of deployment is micro cell design, dividing the seatings and then maintaining the service well in the small cell. Omada EAP high density design can service multiple clients simultaneously and the outdoor EAP can work with directional antennas to focus the service area.
