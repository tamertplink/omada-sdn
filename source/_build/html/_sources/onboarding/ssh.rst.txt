SSH control and monitoring
==========================

You can control and monitor the Omada SDN devices when it is in standalone mode. When the device is adopted and controlled by the Omada SDN controller, the SSH connection is still available, but only for monitoring.

The SSH on Omada devices is disabled by default. You can setup the administration credential directly through the web GUI or through the **site** settings on the controller. 

Enable SSH connection in standalone mode
----------------------------------------

.. note::
    The default IP of the Omada router is 192.168.0.1, the switch and EAP devices acquiring dynamic IP through DHCP. When there is no DHCP server on the network, the switch fall back IP is 192.168.0.1 and the EAP fall back IP is 192.168.0.254. The default user name is ``admin`` with default password ``admin``.

Enable SSH connection in controller mode
----------------------------------------

Navigate to the SSH settings by selecting your site and then ``Settings > Services > SSH`` Enable the ``SSH Login`` Then click on ``Apply`` to enable the SSH. The SSH will be enabled in the whole site. Then, you can access the switches and EAPs through SSH.

To find out the IP address of the device, just navigate to Devices page.

The SSH credential is the device account. When you setup a new site, the controller will choose a random password for you. You can change the credential if you want. Go to the ``Settings > Site and scroll down to the ``Device Account`` section to get the user name and password. Click |reveal| to reveal the password.

SSH from macOS
--------------

When you try to access the Omada switch directly you may see the error message:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    user@MacBook-Pro ~ % ssh admin@192.168.0.1
    Unable to negotiate with 192.168.0.1 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

Which means your macOS is not supporting the key exchange method. You can follow the steps below to enable the SSH connection.

1. Open terminal
2. Edit the SSH configuration file

.. code-block:: bash

    user@MacBook-Pro ~ % sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    Password: 

3. Enter the administrator password.

4. go to the bottom of the file and insert these lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc
    MACs hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com
    HostkeyAlgorithms ssh-dss,ssh-rsa
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

5. Click ``Ctrl-X`` and then ``Y`` to save the file

6. Then try to access the switch again:

.. code-block:: bash

    user@MacBook-Pro ~ % ssh admin@192.168.0.1
    admin@192.168.0.1's password:
