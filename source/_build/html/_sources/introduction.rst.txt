Introduction
============

The Omada SDN solution includes the controllers, wireless access points, managed switches, and business routers.

What is SDN?
------------

The SDN stands for Software Defined Networking. Deploying traditional network devices, you have to have a thorough understanding of the network equipment, the interaction behaviors in between, and the set-up commands to each one of the devices. The Omada SDN abstracts the system controls in one center controller provides smooth integrations on the system level and save the detailed device set up to the software commands.

Controllers
-----------

There are three different flavors of controllers in Omada SDN Solution. Hardware controller, software controller, and cloud based controller. Each controller was designed to server a targeted size of network. The OC200 can manager 100 Omada SDN devices. The OC300 can manage 500 devices. And, the software controller can manage up to 1,500 devices. Cloud based controller is a subscription based management service and has no defined limit in the number of managed devices. 

The network control logics in different controllers are the same. Network devices can be managed together in a site. A site is a logical network group consisted by a group of network devices. In most of the cases, a logical site is usually mapping to a physical network group. Or, it can be defined for managing purpose only.

Once the site has been set up. It can be freely moved from one controller to another without extra effort. You can set up your sites on a single OC200 as a start. As your business is growing, you can migrate the site settings to OC300, software controller or cloud based controller.

Wireless Access Points
----------------------

TP-Link Omada EAP WiFi 6 high density wireless access points were designed for aggregated multi-gig wired and wireless communications need in crowded environments. The 802.11ac wave 2 (WiFi5) access points provide solid connections and well coverages. The 802.11n access points expands the wireless connection everywhere for your IoT devices. 

Managed Switches
----------------

All Omada SDN switches came from the field proof JetStream business manage switches. From 10G, multi-gig, gigabit, to 10/100. Deploy your network as flexible as you can Manage the network as easy as possible. With the Omada controller, setting virtual networks and personal authentications are just a few clicks away.

Load Balance VPN Router
-----------------------

The SafeStream Load Balance VPN routers were designed for small offices as well as telecommute remote access. Connects up to 4 ISP to aggregate bandwidth or line fallback. Easy setup IPSEC VPN and OpenVPN. Attack detection and stateful firewall improves your network safety. Portal access to personalize the network access. Everything you need for fast an safe connections are designed in a single box.

Flexible Deployments
--------------------

**Don’t like the cloud connection? Don’t want a controller agent? No problem!**

Omada SDN solution devices were evolute from traditional networking devices. All devices can still work in standalone mode without controller. The Omada SDN controller can work standalone without TP-Link cloud service. Depends on your design and your favorites, you can design a different network styles with Omada SDN solutions.
